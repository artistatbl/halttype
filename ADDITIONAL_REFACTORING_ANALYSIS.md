### 🔍 New Refactoring Opportunities Identified

## 🏗️ Architecture & Organization Improvements

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. **Settings Component Refactoring** (168 lines)
**Current Issues:**
- Large component with repetitive option rendering patterns
- Hardcoded option arrays within component
- Mixed concerns (data + presentation)
- No reusable option selector components

**Refactoring Strategy:**
```
📁 components/typing-test/settings/
├── Settings.tsx (main orchestrator, ~60 lines)
├── SettingsSection.tsx (reusable section wrapper)
├── OptionGrid.tsx (reusable grid layout)
├── OptionButton.tsx (reusable option button)
├── ToggleButton.tsx (reusable toggle)
└── constants/
    └── settingsOptions.ts (all option data)
```

#### 2. **Main Page Component Optimization** (197 lines)
**Current Issues:**
- Complex state management and effects
- Mixed concerns (SEO, UI state, configuration)
- Large component with multiple responsibilities
- Repetitive focus-based conditional rendering

**Refactoring Strategy:**
```
📁 app/
├── page.tsx (main component, ~80 lines)
├── components/
│   ├── SEOContent.tsx (hidden SEO content)
│   ├── FocusAwareContainer.tsx (focus-based visibility)
│   ├── TestInterface.tsx (test + config container)
│   └── LoadingState.tsx (loading UI)
└── hooks/
    └── usePageState.ts (page-level state management)
```

#### 3. **Hook Complexity Reduction**
**Current Issues:**
- `useConfigStorage.ts` (150 lines) - Complex state synchronization
- `useTypingTestState.ts` (175 lines) - Large state object with many actions
- Potential for state management optimization

**Refactoring Strategy:**
```
📁 hooks/
├── config/
│   ├── useTestConfig.ts (test config only)
│   ├── useUserSettings.ts (user settings only)
│   └── useConfigPersistence.ts (localStorage logic)
├── typing-test/
│   ├── useTestState.ts (core test state)
│   ├── useTestActions.ts (test actions)
│   └── useTestEffects.ts (side effects)
```

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 4. **UI Component Standardization**
**Current Issues:**
- Inconsistent button patterns across components
- Repeated className combinations
- No centralized design system components

**Refactoring Strategy:**
```
📁 components/ui/
├── design-system/
│   ├── OptionButton.tsx (standardized option button)
│   ├── SectionHeader.tsx (consistent section headers)
│   ├── ConfigGrid.tsx (reusable grid layouts)
│   └── FocusContainer.tsx (focus-aware wrapper)
└── constants/
    └── designTokens.ts (consistent spacing, colors)
```

#### 5. **Text Generation Service Enhancement**
**Current Issues:**
- Service logic mixed with hook logic
- Limited error handling and retry mechanisms
- No caching strategy for generated texts

**Refactoring Strategy:**
```
📁 lib/text-generation/
├── services/
│   ├── TextGenerationService.ts (core service)
│   ├── TextCacheService.ts (caching layer)
│   └── TextValidationService.ts (validation)
├── strategies/
│   ├── TimeBasedStrategy.ts
│   ├── WordBasedStrategy.ts
│   └── QuoteBasedStrategy.ts
└── hooks/
    ├── useTextGeneration.ts (simplified hook)
    └── useTextCache.ts (caching hook)
```

#### 6. **Storage Layer Improvements**
**Current Issues:**
- Limited error handling in storage operations
- No data migration strategy
- Tight coupling between storage and components

**Refactoring Strategy:**
```
📁 lib/storage/
├── services/
│   ├── StorageService.ts (abstract base)
│   ├── LocalStorageService.ts (localStorage impl)
│   └── SessionStorageService.ts (sessionStorage impl)
├── migrations/
│   ├── ConfigMigration.ts (config data migration)
│   └── MigrationRunner.ts (migration orchestrator)
└── types/
    └── storage.ts (storage type definitions)
```

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

#### 7. **Performance Optimizations**
**Current Issues:**
- Potential unnecessary re-renders in real-time calculations
- No memoization for expensive operations
- Timer effects could be optimized

**Refactoring Strategy:**
- Implement `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Add `useCallback` for stable function references
- Create custom hooks for debounced operations
- Optimize timer implementation with `useRef`

#### 8. **Type Safety Improvements**
**Current Issues:**
- Some `any` types in configuration handling
- Missing strict type definitions for some interfaces
- Inconsistent type exports

**Refactoring Strategy:**
```
📁 lib/types/
├── config.ts (configuration types)
├── test.ts (test-related types)
├── ui.ts (UI component types)
└── api.ts (API response types)
```

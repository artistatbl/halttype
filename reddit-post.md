# 🚀 I built HaltType - A clean, open-source typing test with 30+ languages!

Hey r/MechanicalKeyboards and typing enthusiasts! 👋

I've been working on **HaltType** in my spare time - a free, open-source typing speed test that focuses on what actually matters: **clean UI, accurate measurements, and zero distractions**.

## ✨ What makes it different?

- **30+ Languages & Coding Languages** - English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, Dutch, Romanian + programming languages (Python, TypeScript, Java, C#, etc.)
- **Real-time WPM & Accuracy** - Precise calculations as you type
- **Multiple Test Modes** - Time-based (15s, 30s, 60s), word count (10, 25, 50, 100), or quotes
- **Customizable Difficulty** - Add punctuation, numbers, or keep it simple
- **Zero Ads, Zero Registration** - Just open and start typing
- **Mobile Friendly** - Works great on phones and tablets
- **Dark Theme** - Easy on the eyes for long practice sessions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (for the devs)

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: Better-auth for user accounts (optional)
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Workers ready

## 🎯 Why I built this

I was frustrated with existing typing tests that were either:
- Cluttered with ads and distractions
- Required sign-ups for basic features
- Had inaccurate WPM calculations
- Lacked language variety
- Had poor mobile experience

So I built something clean, fast, and focused purely on the typing experience.

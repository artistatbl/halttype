# Made a clean typing test with 30+ languages - no ads, no BS ðŸŽ¯

Got tired of typing tests with ads everywhere and terrible mobile experience, so I built **HaltType** in my free time.

**What it does:**
- Real-time WPM + accuracy tracking
- 30+ languages (English, Chinese, French, German, etc.) + coding languages
- Time/word/quote modes
- Works perfectly on mobile
- Zero ads, zero registration required
- Completely free & open source

**Try it**: [Your domain]
**Code**: [Your GitHub]

Built with Next.js + TypeScript. Still adding features like progress tracking and custom texts.

What's your current WPM? ðŸ‘€
